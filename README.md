# CollegeReopening

In [final_report.pdf](https://github.com/pbrazval/CollegeReopening/files/9947628/final_report.pdf) we study the driving factors of the reopening of colleges and universities amid the Covid-19 crisis in 2020. We find that the reopening was strongly associated to political reasons, university's ownership, and endowment. County-level COVID-19 infection rate played a minor role.
